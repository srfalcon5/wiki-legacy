## Building
0. Install Git and [Zola](https://getzola.org)
1. Clone this repo (`git clone git@github.com:doamatto/falcon5-wiki.git`)
2. `make build`. Push changes with `make deploy`.

We operate like [Farer](https://farer.group), which is to say that we operate on the basis of trust. Behave and all is well. Misbehave and you ruin it for everyone.
