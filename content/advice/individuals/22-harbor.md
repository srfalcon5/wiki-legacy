- I learned that as a sports anchor, you should always make a script a day before filming
- Try to film on core on Wednesday or on Tuesday
- Ask Mr. Wilson for the keys and put yourself in the computer room to work on the script
- Get yourself a person to film the sports desk every week so you can focus on the script
- [Learn how to use the green screen studio lights and the red couch studio lights for your background](/hardware/light-board)
- Learn how to interview coaches and other student athletes
- You can also bring students to the studio during core
- Make sure to capture as much after-school football as you can
- Focus on the bigger sports but also include the smaller ones like Tennis, Golf, etc.
- Cage footage is always good to get, football, basketball, volleybal.
- Learn how to edit your own segments. Doing this, I had more fun in creating the show.
