Hello future Senior/Broadcast students. My name is Kyle Stelter and I was on sports desk in 2021-2022. Some advice I have for you guys and some tips to help you for future sports desk people:
  - Always be prepared. You never know when you might have to film an interview.
  - Make friends with people on different teams. Having friends on both the JV and Varsity baseball teams really helped [me make] scripts and helped my partners finding B-roll.

A tip I would have is have a set schedule every single week. Our scripting day was usually Monday and filming day was Tuesday. Getting a consistent schedule makes it easy and fun. Mr Wilson is great, the class is easy and fun; don't make it harder for yourself than it needs to be.
