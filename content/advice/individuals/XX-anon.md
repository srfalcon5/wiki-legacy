- Editing on Final Cut or Premiere doesn't matter because it is preference
- Make sure when filming that the SD card is not locked or it won't record your footage
- Communicate with people when you need people to go and film
- When editing anything that you don't know, you can always find it on YouTube
- Nag people like crazy when they don't respond, because all segments are important
- Have fun with your work such as editing and filming so that you don't find the class boring
- Don't procrastinate on segments, but instead film ahead and plan out
- Be organized and know where you put everything so you don't go seraching for your segment on every computer
- Log everything. When in this class, you will be forgetful and not log stuff.
- Check to make sure you have everything before you leave to film because forgetting stuff wastes your time going back and forth.
- When you say you're going to do something, don't push stuff back and end up not giving a good segment
- Work with people in your class and collaborate with them because it gives you ane xcellent opportnity to have an even better segment
- The 5 W's are an excellent way to plan stuff out (who, what, when, where, why)
- When working with other people, you canf ind out what the other people in the class do
- For example, the falcon proud. For the falcon proud, you have to plan with dr. lawson and pitch an idea on what you are going to film. Such as football where we found 1 person to talk about why they love football, why they joined the team, and any advice. When Dr. Lawson approves of the segment, we submit it and strat thinking of new ideas for another falcon proud, etc.
- This class is the class to express creativity and the worst that can happen is that the idea is terrible and you have to think of a new segment idea

- Humor that doesn't make sense honestly works
- Come up with questions that are interesting, but have the ability to be answered
- Select people that are relevant to the school (Sports, Music, ASB...)
- Write more question than you actually use
- Have a crew to help with questions
- Faster isn't always better
- Come up with ideas for segments that you would actually be intersted in
- Don't feel the need to take Mr. Wilson's ideas for changes for your segment. If you truly think it's perfect, roll with it.
- Ask your friends about the Falcon 5 and what they do with it. It helps a lot.
- Cristicm is necessary to a good segment
- Stay completely focused on the topic in the segment to save run time.

Hello,

You are probably kind of nervous ending off your journey in Video Product/Broadcast. This class will be easy and fun, but only if you produce your segments and do it on schedule. We made a segment about cars because that's what we like doing and the class and Mr. Wilson said it was a good idea. We usually brainstormed Monday about who to interview and what questions we were going to ask. When finding potentional people to interview, you have to remember they must first agree to be on the Falcon Five. We usually asked interviewers or drafted scripts on Tuesday. If the person was free and we had time, we somtimes filmed. At the beginning of the year, we did two in one week, so we always had one in time for Thursdays on time. As you may know, the Faclconf Five airs on Thursdays, and is filmed in the morning. For our segments, we usually had an inteviewer, camera crew (2), and an extra. When our segments were completed we handed it off to the editing crew. The class and Mr Wilson were really supportive, which made it very fun to make.

- The TV cameras are fairly easy to operate, just a simple switch of a lever and a quick removal of the lens cap and it's ready to go
- The TriCaster is less complicated than it looks, trust me, I use it
  - All it takes is a simple switch and it's on
  - ~~We don't know why, but camera 3 on the TriCaster does not work, so only use 1, 2, and 4~~ 
  - DDR1 is the only button you will really be using (this is the button that displays your segments)
  - Press 'Rec' to start your recording and 'Ctrl'+'Rec' to stop the recording
  - Always try to set audio levels before you start filming, cahnging it mid segment results in a sloppier episode
- Be open to trying new things (ex. being in front of camera if you usually aren't in front of the camera and vice-versa)
- Always make sure that the microphone is plugged in correctly, DOUBLE CHECK YOUR GEAR!!
- Never spill water in the studio, control room, or in the classroom (I've never done this before and I have yet to see it happen, but I know it will be bad)
- Try your hardest to achieve the next level, whatever that next level means to you
- Being on your phone the whole period and not doing anything will result in a grade you will not like
- Always push yourself to get that A
- Get out of your comfort zone when on the Falcon 5, get in front of the camera, behind the camera, anchor, or even edit some segments, but don't just be a bump on a log, and do the same things over and over again
- Who, What, Where, When, Why? How?
- When opearting camera one, put on those headphones because you are the anchors countdown for when the next segment is over
- Editing seems scary at first, but ask for help, search up YouTube tutorials, experiment wiht things and it will get easier
- If the equipment somehow breaks, immediately tell Mr. Wilson, do NOT let him find out about it later (he will find out and be furious), just be honest and straight up and he won't be as mad say you hid it from him
- Make as many friends as you can in the class, it's always fun to bounce around the groups and see what they're all doing
- It is okay to make mistakes, just know that there are opportunities to learn and grow from (just don't make the same one twice)
- Have an open mind, be open to new/interesting ideas, who knows, it could be the next big segment on the Falcon 5
- Have a good time, after all, you're only on senior edit crew once
- Over/Under will save your life, trust me, it remove the hassle of having your wire tangle on itself (ask Mr. Wilson if you don't know what this is)
- DO NOT TIP THE SPEAKERS...
  - Make sure to push them from the bottom AND top speaker (if you can, and if you can't then push from the bottom but always look where you are going)
  - Try to avoid hills at all costs
  - If a wheel catches on a rock, don't continue pushing the speaker, it will tip. Instead, try to back out of it and go around the rock
- Always make sure you are on time and show up with your best attitude
- The equipment can get heavy at times, but don't let that keep you from doing what needs to get done
- When plugging in the speakers, always maek sure that the cords are wrapped through the hand holder things (you'll see what I mean)
- If/When you have extra wire, push it underneath the speakers or under the cart that controls all the audio
- Do not touch a wire if it blows (a teacher did this and electrocuted himself, I saw the whole thing)
- Football games:
  - These take awhile to setup but not as long to tear down
  - Meet at classroom right after school on football game days
  - Takes about 20-45min to setup depending on how speedy or slow you are
  - Teardown starts at beginning of 4th quarter and usually everything should be put away before the game is over
  - They do get cold when the sun sets, so bring an extra even if you don't think you'll need it
- If you don't know how to do something or you don't know where something goes, ask a senior production crew member and, if they don't know, ask Mr. Wilson
- Only join production crew if you have a serious dedication for film and production
- If you do make a mistake, it's not the end of the world, just keep trying until you succeed
- Setting up the screen takes a whole lot of teamwork, so don't expect to do it all alone or sit off to the side and watch everyone else set it up.
