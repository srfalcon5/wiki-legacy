- The big cameras are not hard to operate, so don't be intimidated. You just have to turn it on and point.
- Try not to stay in one position. Try to get in front of the camera once in a while.
- Always check on your gear, that everything is in it's place and set in correct or something might fall and break.
- Really REALLY pay attention to "over-and-under," it's the proper way to coil up cable, so pay close attention when Wilson teaches it, it'll SAVE you
- If you have any idea for a segment for the Falcon 5, always go and try to film it, even if you think it's bad. Any idea you have, go and film it. 
- Plan for EVERYTHING, for example, if you're part of production crew and have to set up for a game at 6pm, try to think about the time you'll get there, how long it'll take you to set up, how long to tear down, to get out on time, and things like that. That goes for everything braodcast, not just production crew.

*Helpful Hint:* Falcon 5 is usually filmed and edited by 9:15AM so once you've become familiar with the cameras and Tricaster, start getting into a schedule once Thursday comes.
