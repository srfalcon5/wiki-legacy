- Always have the script done days prior to filming just in case you need to make changes, segments are dropped and/or added
- Get to know your anchors very well so doing the show, adding banter, comes with ease
- Dress accordingly (Go over what colors to wear/not to wear)
  - Make sure to do your hair
- The camera appears inverted on the TV in the studio, so don't be alarmed, you don't actually look like that
- ~~There is a teleprompter app that you can purchase on your iPad (if you have one and you choose to purchase it)~~
  - ~~If you don't have, nor choose to purchase the app (it's $15-$20), you can use a Chromebook. We used a chromebook this year to read off the script during filming.~~
  1. ~~Make text big (so you can see from the anchor desk) and full screen the doc~~
  2. ~~Have someone scroll through the script~~
- Practice reading boring material in an anchor voice to practice
- Make a groupchat for the anchors and another one with your chief editor (so you cantalk about the script in one and changes with the script / asking for the segments in the other)
- Run through the script as much as you can, or until you feel comfortable to being filming
- Always be ready to film on the day of, never be unprepared
- Get the nerves out before you anchor, it might seem scary at first, but trust me, it does get easier
- If you happen to make a mistake while filming, play off of it, DO NOT STOP and tell the camera crew to restart the episode
- We film in the mornings in the studio on the anchor desk, so make sure to get a good night's sleep
- Ensure cell phones are off while filming
- Make an extra document that is filled with banter and filler sentences for when you can't come up with a line for the script (ADD SOME HUMOR INTO THE EPISODE)
- Project your voice when anchoring, no one wants to hear mumbling
- Smile, it'll automatically change your tone of voice
- Always change up the intro/outro script to make it sound interesting each episode
