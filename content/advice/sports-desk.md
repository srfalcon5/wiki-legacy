- **Always be prepared—** you never know when you might have to film an interview.
- **Attend games—** not only can you enjoy the school's games, but it lets you get the B-roll you need to make a great roll.
- **Make friends with those on different teams—** This can help significantly when making scripts and finding the B-roll you need for the roll.
- **Set a weekly schedule—** Designate a day for scripting, a day for filming and editing, and a day to finish editing. Consistency makes it easy and more fun than having to stress to meet deadlines. Don't make it harder for yourself than it needs to be.
