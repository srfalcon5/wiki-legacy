This wiki would not be possible if it weren't for the numerous contributions made by the students.

Special thanks to:
  - **[Daniel Calderon](https://daan.ws), [Matthew Ronchetto](https://maatt.fr)&mdash;** for the initial contributions that helped build this 
  - **[Matthew Ronchetto](https://maatt.fr)&mdash;** providing a domain and hosting for now and into the indefinite future

## Becoming a contributor
Once members of 3,4 move to university, we're unable to maintain this wiki to the best of our ability. Changes are seldomn, but do occur. Members of Broadcast Journalism 3,4 can gain permissions to be educated on how to contribute to this documentation by:
  - asking Mr Wilson to reach out to [Matt](https://maatt.fr) or [Daniel](https://daan.ws) with your contact information
  - reaching out directly to Matt or Daniel with a copy of your transcript showing the course, the school, et al.
