### Installing and using the countdown script
The Class of 2023 wrote an in-house script for OBS that provides the countdown. To install it, [follow the instructions outlined on its web page](https://github.com/srfalcon5/obs-countdown). Using the script is very simple and outlined on that page as well. It should be, bar the countdown text, all configured by default to start at 10:45 AM.

**Note:** every letter you type trying to insert the name of the countdown text will throw an error, causing a pop-up. This isn't by design, but it's a necessary evil to make sure the OBS doesn't crash out on you randomly. To mitigate this, type the name somewhere else and then paste it into the text field- if the text exists, no error will be prompted.

### Capturing the live stream
For awhile, we've had to use a second window of Safari to screen capture. Although this is still an option, we have since unblocked the Monterey Bay Aquarium YouTube channel for sandi.net accounts and SandiNET, which should allow anyone on that network to view its contents, including us to broadcast during a stream. This has not yet been confirmed and requires further documentation.
