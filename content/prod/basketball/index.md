Running a home basketball game is fairly simple—but there are still a few things you should probably know.

## What you need
- **Mixer briefcase (audio)—** should contain at least:
	- Alesis portable mixer board
		- AC power adapter
	- Shure push-to-talk XLR microphone (Announcer)
	- XLR wired microphone (Halftime)
	- TRS cable
	- 3.5mm aux cable
	- XLR cable
	- Lightning to 3.5mm adapter
- **Laptop briefcase (video)**
	- Dell laptop (Windows 10, Core i3)
		- AC power adapter
- **Direct box / "DI"** Should be plugged into bleachers when packing up.
	- 3.5mm to split TRS

## Setting up audio

![wiring diagram for audio](wiring.svg)
1. Ensure that the direct box is plugged into *Line 1* port in the bleachers. It should already be plugged in via XLR.
2. Run the TRS cable from the *Main out (left)* on the mixer to the *In* (left side) on the DI.
3. Plug in your microphone via the XLR you brought to the *MIC 1* XLR port on the mixer.

> ### ⚠️ Not working?
> Ensure the following things are set:
> 1. The power [switch](/prod/basketball/amp.jpg) for the amps are turned on in the storage room
> 2. The [breaker](/prod/basketball/breaker.jpg) for the sound system is flipped on (should be labeled in the breaker box)
> 3. The [volume knobs](/prod/basketball/volume.jpg) for the PA are set to the penciled-in marks (you might need a custodian to unlock this for you)

## Setting up video

1. Ensure that the scoring table is plugged into power
2. Plug in and turn on laptop.
3. Plug in the HDMI cable that comes out of the display-board.
4. Start GamePresenter on the laptop—ensure that you have the proper set of videos selected.

The adverts / player intro videos should display at the top-left corner of your screen.

> ### GamePresenter information
> Before you run a game, it's recommended that you explore the GamePresenter software a little bit to get familiar with quickly doing things.
> Should you need to look through the documentation, you can find the manuals [here](#).
