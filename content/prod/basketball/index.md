Running a home basketball game is fairly simple—but there are still a few things you should probably know.

## What you need
- **Mixer briefcase (audio)—** should contain at least:
	- Alesis portable mixer board
		- AC power adapter
	- XLR wired microphone
	- TRS cable
	- 3.5mm aux cable
	- XLR cable
	- Lightning to 3.5mm adapter
	- TRS to 3.5mm adapter
- **Laptop briefcase (video)**
	- Dell laptop (Windows 10, Core i3)
		- AC power adapter
- **Direct box / "DI"** Should be plugged into bleachers when packing up.

## Setting up audio

1. Ensure that the direct box is plugged into *Line 1* port in the bleachers. It should already be plugged in via XLR.
2. Run the TRS cable from the *Main out (left)* on the mixer to the *In* (left side) on the DI.
3. Plug in your microphone via the XLR you brought to the *MIC 1* XLR port on the mixer.

## Setting up video

1. Plug in and turn on laptop.
2. Plug in the HDMI cable that comes out of the display-board.
3. Start GamePresenter on the laptop—ensure that you have the proper graphics selected.

The adverts/ player intro videos should display at the top-left corner of your screen.
	- **⚠️ Heads up!** Don't put a window or mouse cursor into this region—the audience can see it.
