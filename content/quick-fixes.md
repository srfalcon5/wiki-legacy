**Problem:** no camera output in Tricaster<br/>
**Solutions:**
  - Ensure the Tricaster is set to 1080i (check top left looking for this)
  - Manually set Cameras 1, 2, and 4 to 1080i
    - Hover over the camera on the Tricaster and select the setting cog
    - Change the expected input in the respective dropdown to `1080i`

**Problem:** no display output on the studio's TV<br/>
**Solutions:**
  - Ensure the Tricaster's HDMI cable is plugged in and secure (is either labelled "Studio" or is a two-tone grey and black braided cable)
  - Test the cable with another output to ensure the cable is dead
  - Cry. This has been an issue for awhile due to the cable being dodgy
