In late 2022, CCTE granted funds to make upgrades to the Broadcast program. Allocations were mainly made to refresh / update our production systems. Hardware was chosen to solve certain problems and increase production value. 

The most concerning setback we faced was a lack of teleprompters and tally lights. On-camera talent had to use paper scripts and memorize their next few lines during each segment. Multi-cam productions were also essentially impossible, since if on-camera talent was to switch their line-of-sight in the middle of a show, they'd need to be briefed on when to do everything *before* the show.

As for the production side of things, TriCaster was proving to be difficult in terms of reliability. A terrible stream encoder meant it was difficult to stream onto the web, since an upper resolution limit of 720p was in place and the throughput was so low as to make the picture quality suffer all the time. The system also was difficult to work with when it came to making productions more complex, since live graphics were difficult to wield.
