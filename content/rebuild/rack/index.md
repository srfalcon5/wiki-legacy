This is the general layout of rackmount devices in the production rack. Here are what they are, in order from top to bottom:

## What be?

1. `PRODUCTION` power strip - powers all the Blackmagic equipment since they don't come with power buttons (??). Please turn this off when done for the day.
2. Blackmagic Design ATEM Constellation 8K - the SDI router. 
3. Hyperdeck Studio 4K Pro - allows for media playback and recording
